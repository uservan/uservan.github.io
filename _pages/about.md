Iâ€™m a PhD student in CWRU where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Xiaotian Han](https://ahxt.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my M.S. from [UCR](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/), and my B.S. from [Central South University](https://soa.csu.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
======
* My research focuses on large language models (LLMs), with a particular emphasis on accelerating inference and enhancing their mathematical reasoning capabilities.
